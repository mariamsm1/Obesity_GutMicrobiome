# Project title 
## The gut microbiome and obesity in a population of 12 000 individuals.

# Project overview
In this project, I will be studying the connection between gut bacteria and obesity which is subdivided 
into 3 main phenotypes: BMI, waist circumference adjusted for BMI (WaistadjBMI), and waist-hip ratio 
adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI). 
Such connection will be examined using a series of generalized linear models that are adjusted for multiple 
confounders, LASSO regression, and functional analysis for bacterial proteins and pathways that are 
associated with and enriched in the phenotypes.
