# Project title 
## The gut microbiome and obesity in a population of 12 000 individuals.

# Project overview
In this project, I studied the connection between gut bacteria and obesity which was subdivided 
into 3 main phenotypes: BMI, waist circumference adjusted for BMI (WaistadjBMI), and waist-hip ratio 
adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) in 3 large population cohorts (N = 12028): The Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage 
Study (SCAPIS Malmö and SCAPIS Uppsala) and Malmö Offspring Study (MOS).

## 1. Project description
#### Background:
Multiple studies have demonstrated a connection between obesity and the human gut microbiome, but the 
inconsistency in the findings across different studies  prevented us from drawing any firm conclusions. Our 
aim was to investigate the relationship between gut microbiome and obesity by performing a large 
population-based study with uniform methodologies to decrease the risk of coincidental findings and 
contradictory results.

#### Material and methods: 
In three Swedish population-based cohorts with in total 12 028 participants we performed identical deep 
shotgun gut metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic processing, based on clustering of co-abundant genes 
into metagenomic species (MGS), that enabled identification of both known and unknown species and 
sub-species. We used a series of generalized linear models that are adjusted for multiple confounders, LASSO 
regression, and functional analysis for bacterial proteins and pathways that are associated with and 
enriched in the phenotypes.
