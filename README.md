# Project title 
## A comprehensive analysis of the relationship between BMI and the gut metagenome in large population provides evidence for causal effects of BMI on the gut microbiota diversity, composition and function


# Project overview
In this project, we studied the connection between BMI and gut metagenome in 3 large population cohorts (n = 9,993): The Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage 
Study (SCAPIS Malmö and SCAPIS Uppsala) and Malmö Offspring Study (MOS).

## 1. Project description
#### Background:
The gut microbiome has emerged as a key determinant of cardiometabolic health, with growing evidence linking gut microbial composition and function to body weight regulation, insulin resistance, liver fat accumulation, and cardiovascular risk. Disruptions to this microbial ecosystem, whether through diet, medication, or other environmental exposures, have been associated with metabolic dysfunction and increased cardiometabolic risk.
While cross-sectional microbiome-wide association studies (MWAS) have highlighted robust associations between microbiota features and metabolic phenotypes such as BMI, the direction of these relationships remains largely unresolved. Moreover, discrepancies in study design, sequencing methodology, cohort characteristics, and statistical approaches have further contributed to inconsistencies across studies. A more robust understanding of causality is necessary to translate microbiome research into clinical practice, and requires integrative approaches combining metagenomics, longitudinal designs, and genetic methods such as Mendelian Randomization (MR). In this project, we leverage deep metagenomic sequencing and multiple statistical approaches to identify robust associations and assess potential causal effects of BMI on microbial diversity, species, and functional pathways.
