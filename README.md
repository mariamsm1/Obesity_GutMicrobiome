# Study title 
## BMI shapes gut microbiota diversity, composition, and function in a comprehensive analysis of a large population study

# Study overview
In this project, we studied the connection between BMI and gut metagenome in 3 large Swedish population cohorts (n = 9,993): The Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage 
Study (SCAPIS Malmö and SCAPIS Uppsala) and Malmö Offspring Study (MOS).

#### Abstract:
Growing evidence suggests a strong relationship between the gut microbiome and BMI, but sex-specific differences and causal connections between these multifactorial and modifiable factors have remained underexplored. 
In 9,993 individuals with deep gut metagenomic analysis of three Swedish cohorts we performed a comprehensive analysis using diverse statistical models, that captured unique associations between 1,228 microbial species and BMI, of which 276 species showed directionally consistent BMI-associations across all models.  Our study shows gut microbiome by sex interactions with stronger effect sizes of alpha-diversity, 194 species, and 36 microbial functions on BMI among females compared to males. Using two-sample Mendelian Randomization we found that higher BMI decreases alpha-diversity, affects the relative abundance of 94 species, including increase in 39 oral species, and affects pathways including decreased butyrate production and mucin degradation, and increased propionate production. 
In conclusion, our study shows that BMI may causally shape gut microbiota composition and function, potentially creating a vicious cycle that reinforces weight gain among individuals predisposed to obesity. It also highlights the need for future research to explore sex-specific differences and the oral-gut-brain axis in obesity-related microbiome changes, and the potential of weight loss to counteract the negative effects of adiposity on the gut microbiome.
