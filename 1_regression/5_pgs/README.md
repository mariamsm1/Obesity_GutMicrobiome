1. pgsbmi_species.Rmd : association between PGS(BMI) as exposure and CLR-transformed species relative abundance as outcome. This is run for the analysis of all individuals, sex-stratified, and for sex-interaction.
2. pgsbmi_species_PA.Rmd : association between PGS(BMI) as exposure and species presence/absence as outcome. This is run for the analysis of all individuals, sex-stratified, and for sex-interaction. 
3. pgsbmi_species_pres.Rmd : association between PGS(BMI) as exposure and species presence (discarding all zero abundances) as outcome. This is run for the analysis of all individuals, sex-stratified, and for sex-interaction.
